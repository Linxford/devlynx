the problem:
now i want to do something.....



i sometimes forget about some tools for my dev ........ so i want to have a script or AI or chatbot or something........ that whenever i on my PC boot into my arch it should automatically list all my projects, my dev tools and then ask me what i want to do for today, be able to track my previous workfolw before offing the system etc....... just like a personal assistant...  but should be modern with a nice ui or interface.......... think like me and comeout with someting great or if there is already and existing one out there

and the solution:


🔥 That’s a powerful and visionary idea — a **Modern Dev Personal Assistant** that boots with your Arch Linux system and acts like your intelligent startup dashboard. Here's a concept crafted specifically with your mindset and dev workflow in mind:

---

## 🧠 Concept Name: **DevLynx**

> *"The smart personal boot assistant for focused developers."*

### 🎯 Core Goals:

* Auto-start on boot/login
* List all local projects (code repos)
* Detect and display dev tools installed
* Remember what you were doing last session
* Ask: “What do you want to work on today?”
* Launch selected project in VS Code, terminal, browser, etc.
* Modern, beautiful interface (like a dashboard or TUI)
* Optional voice/text chat (via AI like OpenAI or LM Studio)

---

## 💻 What DevLynx Could Look Like

### 📦 Interface Options:

1. **TUI Dashboard (like `btop` or `lazygit`)**

   * Built with `Go`, `Rust`, or `Python + Rich`
   * Terminal-based, fast, themed

2. **Flutter Desktop App**

   * Uses `flutter_linux` + SQLite for state
   * Beautiful interface with project cards and recent logs

3. **Electron App or Tauri App**

   * Modern cross-platform dashboard
   * Easily integrates with system APIs, prettier GUI

4. **System Tray + CLI + Chat UI (optional AI)**

   * Tray app that you click or launch via command
   * Ask “What project are we opening today?”
   * Saves last task per repo/session

## 🛠️ Possible Startup Setup

Use **systemd** user service to auto-launch:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/devlynx.service
[Unit]
Description=DevLynx Assistant

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/linxford/.local/bin/devlynx
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then:

```bash
systemctl --user enable devlynx
```

## ⚡ Existing Tools (Close But Not Perfect)

| Tool                                                       | Why It's Not Enough                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [`Raycast`](https://www.raycast.com)                       | macOS only, no Linux support             |
| [`DevToys`](https://github.com/veler/DevToys)              | Too utility-focused, not assistant-based |
| [`Ritchie CLI`](https://github.com/ZupIT/ritchie-cli)      | Script launcher, no memory/chat/state    |
| [`Zellij`](https://zellij.dev)                             | Great TUI terminal manager, no AI/state  |
| [`Taskwarrior`](https://taskwarrior.org)                   | CLI TODO tracker, no modern UI or AI     |
| [`Homebrew DevDash`](https://github.com/Phantas0s/devdash) | Good dashboard but limited interactions  |

## 🧪 Next Step: MVP Plan

We can start building a basic prototype that:

1. Scans projects in a specific folder
2. Lists recent tools used (via `which`)
3. Saves `last_project.json` with timestamp, tools, notes
4. Prompts you with choices: \[Continue], \[New Project], \[Quit]
5. Launches dev environment

Want me to help:

* Scaffold a **TUI prototype (Rust or Python)?**
* Set up a **Flutter Desktop UI app**?
* Start a GitHub repo with `devlynx`?

Let’s make this real — this is exactly the kind of modern dev AI assistant we need.


now the current state of the project: is the current dir
